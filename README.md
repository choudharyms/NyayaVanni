# ⚙️ Installation & Setup

# 🖥️ Prerequisites

Before running the project install:

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- Git
- Tesseract OCR

---

# 🔧 Backend Setup

## 1️⃣ Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/NyayaVanni.git
cd NyayaVanni
```

---

## 2️⃣ Navigate to Backend

```bash
cd backend
```

---

## 3️⃣ Create Virtual Environment

### Windows

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Linux/Mac

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

## 4️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 5️⃣ Configure Environment Variables

Create `.env`

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

---

## 6️⃣ Run Backend Server

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Backend runs at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

---

# 💻 Frontend Setup

## 1️⃣ Navigate to Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
```

---

## 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

## 3️⃣ Configure Frontend Environment

Create `.env`

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

---

## 4️⃣ Run Frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

---

# 🧪 Frontend Validation

Run these commands from the `frontend/` directory before submitting UI changes.

## 1️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## 2️⃣ Check code quality

```bash
npm run lint
```

## 3️⃣ Verify the production build

```bash
npm run build
```

## 4️⃣ Preview the built UI locally

```bash
npm run preview
```

Open the preview URL shown in the terminal and manually verify the touched UI flow.

## Current UI test status

The frontend currently does not define a dedicated unit or integration test script in `frontend/package.json`. Until a test runner is added, use `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, and a local preview smoke check as the required frontend validation path.

When a test runner is introduced, add the command to `frontend/package.json` and document it here, for example:

```bash
npm run test
```

---

# 🔑 Environment Variables

## Backend `.env`

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

---

## Frontend `.env`

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

---

# 📡 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|

# ⚠️ OCR Failure Protection

NyayaVanni prevents AI hallucinations when OCR extraction fails.

## ✅ Validation Added

The backend now checks:

- Empty OCR output
- Extremely low text extraction
- Unreadable or corrupted documents
- Failed parsing attempts

If OCR fails:

- AI legal analysis is stopped
- Fake legal sections are NOT generated
- Users receive a clean fallback message

### Example Response

```json
{
  "status": "ocr_failed",
  "message": "Unable to extract readable text from the document."
}
```

### Windows

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Then run:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

---

## ❌ OCR Not Working

Install Tesseract OCR.

### Windows Download
